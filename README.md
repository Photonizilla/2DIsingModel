# 2DIsingModel

$ d=2 $ Ising model describes a system with Hamiltonian

$$ \beta H = - J \sum_{\left<i,j\right>}s_is_j - h \sum_i s_i $$

where $ J > 0 $ for ferromagnets. The partition function is

$$ Z = \sum_{\{s_i\}} \exp \left( J \sum_{\left<i,j\right>}s_is_j + h \sum_i s_i \right). $$

Probability distribution function

$$ p(\{s_i\}) = \frac{1}{Z} \mathrm{e}^{-H(\{s_i\})}. $$

Let's investigate the expectation value of magnetic momentum $ M(\{s_i\}) = \frac{1}{N}\sum_i s_i $

$$ \left<M\right> = \frac{1}{NZ} \sum_{\{s_i\}} M(\{s_i\}) \mathrm{e}^{-H(\{s_i\})}. $$
